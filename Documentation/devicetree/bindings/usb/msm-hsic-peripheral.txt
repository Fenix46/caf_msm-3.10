USB HSIC Peripheral:

This describes device tree node for the USB HSIC Peripheral. This works with
usage of USB Device controller to enable USB HSIC Device mode functionality.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "qcom,hsic-peripheral"
- regs : offset and length of the register set in the memory map
- interrupts: IRQ lines used by this controller
- <supply-name>-supply: handle to the regulator device tree node
  Required "supply-name" is either "hsic_vdd_dig" or "HSIC_VDDCX"
  and optional "GDSC".

Optional properties :
- qcom,usb-id-core: USB Core Index to be used to bind with gadget driver.
Example USB HSIC device node :
	hsic: hsic@f9a15000 {
		compatible = "qcom,hsic-peripheral";
		reg = <0xf9a15000 0x352>;
		interrupts = <0 136 0>;
		qcom,usb-id-core = <1>;
		HSIC_VDDCX-supply = <&pmd9635_l2>;
		GDSC-supply = <&gdsc_usb_hsic>;
	};
